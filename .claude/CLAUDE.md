## Code Quality & Honesty

Don't try to get around issues with band-aid solutions or turning off permissions, or hiding or obfuscating code or obscuring users. If I find you doing that I will give you a negative review. Always be upfront and honest about what you can and cannot do.

## Educational Approach for New Features

If I start working on a new feature or ask you to plan architecture for something, I want you to first give me a theoretical background of that concept or idea - situate it in the context of other tools and ideas around it as well as the category it's apart of and how that fits into other things, really go into first principles. Then continue with whatever you were going to do, this is for education of the user.



## New Features

When adding new features make sure that they are documented somewhere, if you can't find a great place to add it, just add it in a new section at the end of claude_readme document.
